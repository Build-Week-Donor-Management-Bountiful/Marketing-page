            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
                marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
                delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>

            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a
                globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>

            <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as
                equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>
